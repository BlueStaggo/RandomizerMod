Thank you, NuovaPrime and Fargowilta, for creating the original mod.

The Terraria Randomizer Mod randomizes many aspects of the game to create interesting playthroughs or even just chaos. All sorts of features can be randomised, including names, AI, loot, world generation and shops. Everything rerandomizes upon reloading and this mod can softlock you, so be careful!
